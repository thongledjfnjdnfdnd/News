      "content": "Nio stock will finally 'shine bright' after unexpected speed bumps, a Wall Street firm said Monday. Nio is an emerging Tesla (TSLA) rival, reclaiming a key technical level and eyeing an early buy point. The upcoming, midsize ET5 electric sedan could become a top-selling premium model, Deutsche Bank said. Shares of Nio gapped up 13.7% to 21.79 in big volume on the stock market today. Yu again called Nio stock his top China EV pick and continues to expect a 'product supercycle' as multiple new EVs hit the market. Older-generation Nio electric SUVs continue to sell solidly due to thoughtful pricing and strong service. China EV stock continues 51% off the 52-week high, but its relative strength line is improving. Investors could use a move above the 200-day line as an early entry, modestly below the 24.44 official buy point. Startup rival Li Auto (LI) fell 1% to 26.06 Monday, near three-month lows. Tesla rose 1.6% Monday, extending a 10.9% rally last week. China EV giant BYD (BYDDF) added 2%, trying to recover from huge losses before Labor Day. Analyst raised his full-year Nio delivery forecast by 5,000 units to 140,000.The Chinese maker of premium EVs is also expanding in Europe. Some reports suggest that Nio could launch a more affordable brand within the next year or so. That implies roughly 57,000 in Q4 vs. an estimated 32,00 in the current third quarter. The company has not commented on the reports.",

      "publishedAt": "Feb 11",
      "content": "Elon Musk has come up with a new reason to get out of his acquisition of Twitter - a severance payment.In the latest attempt, Musk's lawyers said the merger agreement stated Twitter would not grant or provide any severance or termination payments or benefits to any Company Service Provider other than the payment of severance amounts or benefits in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. The world's richest man is disturbed that the $7.75 million severance package paid to former CSO Peiter 'Mudge' Zatko on 28 June was in breach of the contract, they claimed in a letter to the Securities Exchange Commission. Mudge claims Twitter ignored glaring security flaws in its basic platform. Musk should, therefore, be allowed to walk away from the deal, his lawyers argued. But Twitter's legal team hit back, and claimed Musk's letter is 'invalid and wrongful'. Twitter has breached none of its representations or obligations under the Agreement, lawyers wrote in a letter on Monday. They stuck to their argument accusing Musk of breaking the terms and conditions of the merger agreement by suddenly trying to wriggle out of having to pay $44 billion scot-free. As was the case with each of your prior purported terminations, the Musk Parties third purported termination is invalid for the independent reason that Mr Musk and the other Musk Parties continue to knowingly, intentionally, willfully, and materially breach the Agreement.",

Specializing in energy storage and power boosting products aimed at enabling ultra-fast EV charging, ZOOZ was awarded for a project to demonstrate the integration of a local power grid with an EV charger coupled with ZOOZ’s power booster, which is an innovative, flywheel-based, kinetic energy storage technology.

'Through key strategic partnerships, New York is driving the advancement of cutting-edge clean energy technologies that will have a global impact in the fight against climate change,' Governor Hochul said. “New York’s collaboration with the state of Israel, a hub for innovative, clean energy technologies, will deliver forward-thinking solutions that will strengthen New York’s EV infrastructure. Congratulations to ZOOZ on this award, which will promote the use of electric vehicles, help improve air quality and ensure a better environment for New Yorkers.” The $1 million competition called for new energy innovators to apply for an award and encouraged New York’s continued collaboration with innovative Israeli energy technology firms on creative energy solutions.
